- 👋 Hi, I’m @DominykaGarnet
-  I will forever be a student of the all things creative. My passion has been art for as long as I can remember.
   There isn't a medium that I don't enjoy working with. There isn't one I'm afraid to try.
   Trying always leads to creating. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics in coding (HTML and CSS).
- My current goal is to eventually dive deeper and get familiar with WordPress, JavaScript, Python, and more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various web design projects.
- I find that community and collaboration leads to the creation of incredible new innovative projects.
